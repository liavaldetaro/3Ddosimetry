This area includes the following files
latex_template_MedPhys_2018.tex	 Example template .tex file
latex_template_MedPhys_2018.pdf  pdf file produced from template file 
 			by pdflatex
example.bib		Bibliography file needed to latex the template.
			However, for final submission, the example.bbl
			file created when running bibtex should be cut
			and pasted into the .tex file. See discussion near
			end of the template .tex file
f_curve_1overV.agr	xmgrace source file which created the 2 formated
			figures used in the example. It is not needed
			to run the example. xmgrace is freeware.
f_curve_1overV.jpg	Example figure in jpg format. Each figure must be 
			downloaded with the tex file when submitting.
f_curve_1overV.pdf	Example figure in pdf format. It is much sharper
			than the .jpg version, at least when using xmgrace
lineno.sty		This package is not part of all pdflatex
			installations so is included here in case missing.
medphy.bst		This file defines the format of the references
			produced from the .bib file. It is as close as we
			could get to the Medical Physics style (but not
			perfect so if you can improve it, please share with
			us all).
